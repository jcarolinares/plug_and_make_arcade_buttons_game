# plug_and_make_arcade_buttons_game

A small game where two persons competes again to each other to see who press a button a number of times faster than the other. Made with the Arduino Plug and Make kit.

# Assembly

The game can easily adopt different shapes and be quickly adapted to different surfaces and needs. Just keep in mind people with beat the buttons as fast as possible so the surface must be strong enough to resist the force applied during the game.

You will need a surface or box big enough to hold the Arduino Plug and Make Kit with the base plate + space for two arcade buttons. Check the Bill Of Materials inside the 'aux' folder to know more.
